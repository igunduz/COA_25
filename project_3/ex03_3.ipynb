    "\n",
    "We will consider a simplified collaborative filtering problem. \n",
    "Let's say that we have $M$ users and $N$ movies. A user $i$ can provide some rating from $1$ to $5$ for the movie $j$ depending on how much they liked it. We can store these ratings in a matrix $A \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}^{N\\times M}$. Note that, not every user will rate every movie so some of the entries of $A$ will be missing. Practically speaking, only a small fraction of entries of $A$ are available. In order to predict if a movie is suitable for a user or not we would like to predict the rating that the user might give to the movie. And we also assume that customers who vote similarly tend to have similar preference on movies. This can be casted as a matrix completion problem, i.e., fill in all the missing entries of $A$ and ensure $A$ a low rank matrix."
